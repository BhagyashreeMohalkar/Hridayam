## 📘 About the Project

**Hridayam** is a 🌐 web-based **AI-powered system** built to assess the risk of ❤️ heart disease from user-provided health parameters. With the goal of **early detection** and **increased accessibility** to cardiovascular health screening, Hridayam delivers quick, interpretable predictions while prioritizing **user privacy** and **education**.  

🔑 **Key motivations**:  
- 💡 **Preventive care**: Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early insights can drive timely medical action.  
- 🌍 **Accessibility**: Enable users anywhere to check risk factors without requiring a clinic visit.  
- 🔍 **Transparent AI**: Provide insight into how the system arrives at predictions and explain influential factors.  
- 🔒 **Privacy-first**: Data is processed securely and not stored permanently, ensuring user confidentiality.

## ✨ Features

- ✔️ Predict risk of heart disease from health inputs (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)  
- 🖥 Clear, **user-friendly interface**  
- 🔐 **Privacy-focused**: no permanent storage of health data  
- 📊 **Educational insights**: shows potential risk factors and recommendations  
- ⚡ **Fast performance** for quick feedback

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📝 **User Input**: Users enter health-related attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).  
2. 🤖 **Model Inference**: A trained machine learning model processes input and outputs a risk prediction.  
3. 📈 **Risk Interpretation**: The system displays a risk level (low / medium / high) with explanations of contributing factors.  
4. 🩺 **Helpful Resources**: The app provides recommendations (lifestyle, diet, doctor consultation) and educational content about heart health.
